# Teensy Fan Controller Prototype v1

Schmart Board based Teensy Fan Controller prototype v1.

TODO

## Notes

- 1% accuracy resistors should be used, though specific resistances can be configured to account for less accurate resistors
- The jumper in the middle ties v3.3 to ADC reference voltage
- The capacitors are not described in the prototype layout
- Only 3 of the 4 sensor resistors are soldered in the images
- The 4 fan headers in a row should be split in the middle, or possibly re-arranged in a 3 x 2 configuration
