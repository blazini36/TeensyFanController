# Router Cooling Demo

The controller is configured to cool a temperature sensor (placed between a desk router and switch) to a specific temperature.


## Hardware Requirements

1. A Teensy Fan Controller (fe. [Breadboard][1], [Schmart Board prototype][2], [Simple PCB][3])
1. One Teensy 3.x with headers (previously *flashed with Teensy Fan Controller*)
1. A Micro USB cable
1. One 12v power supply (up to 15V should be OK)
1. One PWM PC fan (80mm, 120mm, 140mm)
1. Wires

## Sensor and fan placement

- The temperature sensor is placed between the cases of a router stacked on top of a switch
- The fan is pointed at the router/switch
