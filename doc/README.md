A PC fan controller with temperature sensor input, for **Teensy 3.x** USB Development Board(s).

Supports up to 6 fans (4pin/PWM), and up to 5 temperature sensors (thermistors). Each fan may individually operate in PID, temperature-percent table, or fixed-percent control modes.

Designed to control radiator fans on a PC water cooling loop (to maintain supply water temperature), but may be configured for other purposes (for example, see [Hardware/Router cooling demo][2]).
